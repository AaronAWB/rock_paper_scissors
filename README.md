## Summary

This is a simple "rock, paper, scissors" that pits the player against a random selection by the computer. The player makes their selection by clicking one of the icon buttons and a mesasge is displayed showing the player's choice, the computer's choice, and whether the user player. The player can play as many rounds as they want and the player's wins and the computer's wins are recorded at the bottom of the screen.

One challenge I encountered in building this project was how to visually separate the rounds and provide feedback to the player showing the round was over and that they could make their next choice. I addressed that by adding a feature that displays the current round number in between rounds. The outcome of a round is displayed for two seconds, then the game is reset and the round number is updated. This also allows the player to tell how many rounds they have won out of the total number of rounds played.
